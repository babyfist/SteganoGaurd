# SteganoGuard

SteganoGuard is a web-based tool built with Next.js that allows you to hide and sign secret messages within files using steganography and cryptography. It ensures both the confidentiality and authenticity of your hidden data.

## Features

*   **Encode & Sign**: Embed secret messages into images and other files, with optional visible watermarks.
*   **Decode & Verify**: Extract and decrypt hidden messages from valid SteganoGuard files.
*   **Digital Signatures**: Sign messages with your unique identity to guarantee authenticity and integrity.
*   **Hybrid Encryption**: Secure messages for specific recipients using their public keys.
*   **Identity Management**: Create, import, export, and manage multiple cryptographic identities.
*   **Contact Management**: Store trusted contacts' public keys for easy and secure sharing.
*   **Web Extension Ready**: Can be built as a static site and loaded as a browser extension.

## Getting Started

To get the project running locally, follow these steps.

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit and integration testing.

To run the test suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Test files are located in the `__tests__` directory.

## Example Files

The `public/examples` directory contains sample JSON files that can be used to test the application's import functionality.

*   **`example_identity_backup.json`**: A full backup of a single identity, including its private keys. Use this with the "Import Identity" function.
*   **`example_contact_public_key.json`**: The public keys for a single contact ("Bob"). Use this with the "Add Contact" function when importing a single contact.
*   **`example_contact_list.json`**: A list of public keys for multiple contacts. Use this with the "Add Contact" function to import multiple contacts at once.

## Packaging as a Web Extension

This application has been configured to support static export, allowing it to be packaged as a browser extension.

### 1. Build the Static Files

Run the standard build command. Because of the `output: 'export'` configuration in `next.config.ts`, this will generate a static version of the app in the `/out` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Prepare the Manifest and Icons

A `public/manifest.json` file has been created for you. To complete the setup, you must create the following icon files and place them in the `public/` directory.

*   `public/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
*   `public/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
*   `public/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

The manifest file (`public/manifest.json`) already references these icons.

### 3. Load the Extension in Your Browser

1.  Open your browser's extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` in Chrome).
2.  Enable "Developer mode".
3.  Click "Load unpacked".
4.  Select the `out` folder that was generated by the `npm run build` command.

The SteganoGuard icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar.
