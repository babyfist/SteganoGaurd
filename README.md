# SteganoGuard

SteganoGuard is a web-based tool built with Next.js that allows you to hide and sign secret messages within files using steganography and cryptography. It ensures both the confidentiality and authenticity of your hidden data.

## Packaging as a Web Extension

This application has been configured to support static export, allowing it to be packaged as a browser extension.

### 1. Build the Static Files

Run the standard build command. Because of the `output: 'export'` configuration in `next.config.ts`, this will generate a static version of the app in the `/out` directory.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 2. Create the Manifest File

Your browser needs a `manifest.json` file to understand the extension. Create a new file at `public/manifest.json` and add the following content. You will also need to create icons and place them in the `public/` directory.

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "name": "SteganoGuard",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "A steganography and cryptography tool to hide and sign secret messages within files.",
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "icon16.png",
      "48": "icon48.png",
      "128": "icon128.png"
    }
  },
  "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  }
}
```

### 3. Load the Extension in Your Browser

1.  Open your browser's extension management page (e.g., `chrome://extensions` in Chrome).
2.  Enable "Developer mode".
3.  Click "Load unpacked".
4.  Select the `out` folder that was generated by the `npm run build` command.

The SteganoGuard icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar.

### 4. Optional: Clean Up Unused Component Files

The following UI component files are not currently used by the application and can be safely deleted if you wish:

- `src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/calendar.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/chart.tsx`
- `src/components/ui/form.tsx`
